Time series forecasting is a powerful analytical technique used to predict future values based on historical data. It plays a crucial role in various domains such as finance, economics, weather forecasting, supply chain management, and more. By analyzing patterns, trends, and dependencies within a time series dataset, forecasting models aim to provide accurate predictions and insights into future behavior.

The first step in time series forecasting is to understand the characteristics of the data. Time series data consists of a sequence of observations collected over time, where each observation is associated with a specific timestamp. These observations may exhibit trends, seasonality, cyclic patterns, or irregularities, which need to be identified and accounted for in the forecasting process.
